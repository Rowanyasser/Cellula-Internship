# Cellula-Internship
# ðŸ¦· Teeth Classification with Deep Learning

##  Overview
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model for classifying dental images into **seven categories** related to oral health conditions:  

- **CaS**
- **CoS** 
- **Gum** 
- **MC**
- **OC**
- **OLP** 
- **OT**

The goal is to assist in **automated dental diagnostics** potentially helping dentists in early detection and treatment planning.

##  Dataset
- Images are stored in a folder structure with **train / validation / test splits**, where each subfolder represents a class.  
- The dataset was loaded using `tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory`.  
- Preprocessing included:  
  - **Normalization** (rescaling pixel values to [0,1])  
  - **Data Augmentation**: RandomFlip, RandomRotation, RandomZoom, RandomTranslation  

---

##  Model Architecture
- Built with **TensorFlow & Keras**  
- CNN with:  
  - Multiple **Conv2D + BatchNormalization + MaxPooling** blocks  
  - Dense layers with **Dropout (0.5, 0.3)**  
  - **L2 regularization** to reduce overfitting  
- Trained using:  
  - **Categorical Cross-Entropy loss** with **Label Smoothing**  
  - **Adam Optimizer**  
  - **50 epochs** with callbacks (EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau)  

---

##  Results
- **Test Accuracy:** **95%**  
- **Confusion Matrix:** strong diagonal dominance, meaning most predictions were correct.  
- **Classification Report:**  
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score all **above 0.90** for most classes.  
  - Slightly lower recall for OLP due to similarity with OC/MC.  

---

##  Visualizations
- **Histograms of Pixel Intensities** (RGB) â†’ showed discriminative color features across classes.  
- **Sobel Edge Maps** â†’ highlighted boundaries of teeth and lesions.  
- **t-SNE plots** â†’ showed good class separability in feature space.  
- **Confusion Matrix** â†’ revealed strengths and misclassifications.  

---

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with **deeper CNNs or transfer learning** (ResNet, EfficientNet).  
- Use **class balancing** and **advanced augmentations** (CutMix, MixUp). 
- Deploy as a **web or mobile app** for real-time use in dental clinics.
